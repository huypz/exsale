# My POS (Point of Sale System)

## What it does
We created this web application that allows suppliers to sell products to users all while managing and tracking their sales and stock. Users can purchase listed products, and suppliers can view transactions and receive special reports.

## How we built it
We built it using MySQL, PHP, and JQuery. The frontend was built with HTML/CSS and Javascript.
